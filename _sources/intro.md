# Advanced Computational Methods in Stats

This is a companion webpage to the LTCC course in Advanced Computational Methods in Statistics for the academic year 2024-2025. This lecture is delivered by [O. Deniz Akyildiz](https://akyildiz.me) at London Course Taught Centre (LTCC).

Main resources for this year will be the slides and notebooks that I will upload here.

 See [this page](https://akyildiz.me/stochastic-simulation) for the resources from my undergraduate course, which is largely relevant. See [Bayesian filtering summer course](https://akyildiz.me/ssbf-2024-intro) for some extra material on Bayesian filtering.
 
## Slides

Slides can be found below. I will try to upload them before the lecture.

Please download the slides and open it with Adobe Acrobat if you want to see the animations (activates when you click). They wonâ€™t run on your browser.
