# Advanced Computational Methods in Stats

This is a companion webpage to the LTCC course in Advanced Computational Methods in Statistics.

For past year's materials, see [this webpage](https://github.com/nkantas/LTCC-Advanced-Computational-Methods-in-Statistics) as a good starting point. See [this page](https://akyildiz.me/stochastic-simulation) for the resources from my undergraduate course, which is largely relevant.

But we will be deviating from the past year's materials and main resources for this year will be the slides and notebooks.
